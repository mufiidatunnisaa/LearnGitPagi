Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry II 
(/ˈstɛfən/ STEF-ən; born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball 
player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
Many analysts and players have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.
He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams to 
regularly utilize the three-point shot.
A six-time NBA All-Star, Curry has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) 
twice and won three NBA championships with the Warriors.


The son of a former NBA player Dell and the older brother of current NBA player Seth, 
Curry played college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats. He set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson 
and the Southern Conference and was twice named the conference's player of the year. 
During his sophomore year, Curry also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made, 
and was then selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft.
In 2014–15, Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. 
The following season, he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and 
to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, 
the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals,
 which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry helped the Warriors return to the 
 BA Finals in 2017, 2018 and 2019, winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, 
 before being defeated by the Toronto Raptors in 2019.

During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season, with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. Curry is currently third in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history, and alongside teammate Klay Thompson, the pair have earned the nickname of the Splash Brothers; in 2013–14, they set the record for combined three-pointers in an NBA season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678).
